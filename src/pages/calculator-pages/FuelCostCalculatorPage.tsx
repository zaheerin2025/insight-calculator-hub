          <>
            <p>The fuel cost calculator uses the following formulas:</p>
            <p><strong>Fuel Used = Distance ÷ Fuel Efficiency</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Total Cost = Fuel Used × Price per Gallon (or Liter)</strong></p>
            <p>For round trips, the distance is doubled:</p>
            <p><strong>Round Trip Distance = One-way Distance × 2</strong></p>

            question: "How can I reduce my fuel costs?",
            answer: "You can reduce fuel costs by improving driving habits (avoiding rapid acceleration and braking), maintaining your vehicle properly (regular oil changes, proper tire pressure), removing excess weight from your vehicle, combining errands into fewer trips, and using apps to find the lowest fuel prices in your area."
          },
          {
            question: "Why do fuel costs vary so much between different trips of the same distance?",
            answer: "Fuel costs can vary due to different driving conditions (city vs. highway), traffic congestion, weather conditions, terrain (hills use more fuel), vehicle load, and fluctuating fuel prices."
          },
          {
            question: "Is it more fuel-efficient to use AC or open windows?",
            answer: "At lower speeds (typically under 40 mph), open windows are more fuel-efficient. At higher speeds, the aerodynamic drag from open windows uses more fuel than running the AC. Modern AC systems are also more efficient than older ones."
          },
          {
            question: "How does fuel type affect my calculations?",
            answer: "Different fuel types have different prices and energy content. Diesel typically provides better mileage than gasoline but may cost more. Premium gasoline costs more than regular, and unless your vehicle requires it, typically doesn't improve fuel economy enough to offset the higher price."
