            <p>The electricity bill calculator uses the following formula to estimate your electricity costs:</p>
            <p><strong>Total Cost = Energy Consumption (kWh) Ã— Rate per kWh + Fixed Charges</strong></p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Energy Consumption is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh)</li>
              <li>Rate per kWh is the price you pay for each unit of electricity</li>
              <li>Fixed Charges include service fees, taxes, and other constant costs</li>
