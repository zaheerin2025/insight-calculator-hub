            <p>The mortgage calculator uses the following formula to calculate your monthly payment:</p>
            <p><strong>M = P [ r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]</strong></p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>M = Monthly payment</li>
              <li>P = Principal loan amount (the amount borrowed)</li>
              <li>r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)</li>
              <li>n = Total number of payments (loan term in years Ã— 12)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The calculator also computes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Total amount paid over the life of the loan</li>
              <li>Total interest paid</li>
              <li>Amortization schedule showing principal and interest breakdown for each payment</li>

            question: "How much house can I afford?",
            answer: "Financial experts recommend that your monthly mortgage payment (including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income. Your total debt payments should not exceed 36% of your income."
          },
          {
            question: "Should I choose a 15-year or 30-year mortgage?",
            answer: "A 15-year mortgage typically has lower interest rates and builds equity faster, but has higher monthly payments. A 30-year mortgage offers lower monthly payments but costs more in total interest over the life of the loan. Choose based on your financial situation and goals."
          },
          {
            question: "How does my down payment affect my mortgage?",
            answer: "A larger down payment reduces your loan amount, monthly payment, and total interest paid. Down payments of less than 20% typically require private mortgage insurance (PMI), which adds to your monthly costs. Some loan programs offer lower down payment options."
          },
          {
            question: "What's included in a mortgage payment?",
            answer: "A typical mortgage payment includes principal (paying down the loan balance), interest (cost of borrowing), property taxes, and homeowners insurance. These are often referred to as PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance)."
          },
          {
            question: "How can I reduce my mortgage costs?",
            answer: "You can reduce mortgage costs by making a larger down payment, shopping around for the best interest rates, improving your credit score before applying, choosing a shorter loan term, making extra payments toward principal, or refinancing when rates drop significantly."
